# Lab | mini-project-ironkaggle

## Introduction

In this lab, we will collaborate in groups on a project using a real dataset. 
Our goal is to compare different models for predicting sales. We will evaluate and explain how each model works, and ultimately determine which one is the best choice based on their performance.
In this case we use the models: Random Forest Performance, Xgbboost performance and Stacking Model Performance.
